RPertoire is an app where users can edit a music program, a list for an event.
The user can post the lyrics, the description, the title of the Song that will be played and build a program with it.
He can create several Lists with a Name, a description, and his songs in it.
He can order them the way he wants, translate them (name and description of the list – lyrics and title of the songs) in five different languages(ar|en|es|fr|nb). It uses Google Cloud Translation API.

Finally when the program is built, the list give access via QRCode, and print a pdf with:
- The Name of the List (and a picture)
— The Songs with their own tonality)
- The Description of the List (the event, the recommendations)
- The QRCode (A4 format) that the host can put at the entry of the event.

We can reduce the printing of programs inside so many venues. the program gives access just with one QRCode to everybody about all the necessary informations for the show, including lyrics and their translations.
Next step of the program is to give access to translations with a subscription | give free access without translations.
